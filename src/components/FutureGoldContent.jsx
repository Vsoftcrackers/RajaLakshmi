            The MKM Future Gold Scheme is designed for individuals who wish to invest in gold over an 11-month period.

This scheme offers an excellent opportunity for individuals to invest in gold in a flexible, affordable, and structured manner, while taking advantage of price fluctuations in the gold market.
